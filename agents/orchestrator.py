Orchestrator Agent — routes user queries to specialist agents and runs them in parallel.

Routing is done via LLM classification (single fast API call):
  threshold    → ThresholdAgent    (FP/FN tuning, alert stats)
  segmentation → SegmentationAgent (clustering, dynamic segmentation, alerts distribution)
  policy       → PolicyAgent       (AML policy, regulatory questions)
  greeting     → friendly greeting response (no agent run)
  policy       → default for anything unclassified (base model handles gracefully)

You are a routing classifier for ARIA. Given a user query, respond with \
one or more of these labels (comma-separated, no other text):

  threshold    — user wants to RUN threshold tuning analysis on OUR LOCAL DATA (FP/FN trade-off charts, sweep analysis)
  segmentation — user wants to RUN clustering/segmentation on OUR LOCAL DATA (K-Means, treemap, behavioral groups)
  ofac         — user wants to RUN OFAC sanctions screening on OUR LOCAL CUSTOMER DATA (SDN list hits, sanctioned country exposure)
  policy       — user is asking a GENERAL KNOWLEDGE question about AML, compliance, regulations, industry practices, or best practices — does NOT require running local data analysis
  greeting     — query is a greeting or social pleasantry (hello, hi, how are you, etc.)
  out_of_scope — query is not related to any of the above AML topics

        "- **Customer segmentation** — identify behavioral risk clusters using K-Means across transaction velocity, volume, and account characteristics\n"

        "For each threshold column — average transaction amount, monthly transaction volume, or weekly transaction count — "

        "transaction velocity, volume, average amounts, account age, and account type. Each cluster gets a risk "

        "how the rule's SAR catch rate changes as its threshold is adjusted. A 2D sweep maps two parameters "
